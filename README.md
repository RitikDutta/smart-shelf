# Smart Shelf
so many words, so little time. Simply give your smart shelf a voice command or app, and you're in full account of your life like never before - from knowing who's at the door and changing the room's temperature with just one tap. We know time is precious, this is why we've made sure that our shelves also have in-built smart features to optimize it for you.  

smart shelf has built in lights, power sockets and phone charge slots. All this is controlled by your voice or the internet. With mains sockets onboard, you'll never need to worry about running out of mobile power - the smart home never felt so good. 

Get the home you've always envisioned while discovering what's new in smart-home technology with the smart shelf! With features like voice control, remote access with your favorite smartphone app, and a sleek, wireless design that looks great in any room. 

The dynamic lights are perfect for "dinner time, movie night"!
